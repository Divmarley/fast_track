# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values


# performing operations on variables
# age = 100
# motherAge = 200 
# ans =age + motherAge
# print(ans)

# perform operations on values
# print(100 + 200)
a=1 
b= 3

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# + / - * % ** //

# print(a+b) 
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a ** b)
# print(a % b)
# print(a // b)



# Assignment operators 
age = 30


# x+=y  #same as x = x + y
# x-=y
# x/=y
# x*=y
# x**=y
# x%=y
# x//=y

 
# Comparison operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare values 
# Operator	    Name	                        Example	
# ==	        Equal	                        x == y	
# !=	        Not equal	                    x != y	
# >	            Greater than	                x > y	
# <	            Less than	                    x < y
# >=	        Greater than or equal to	    x >= y	
# <=	        Less than or equal to	        x <= y


# Logical operators 
# Operator	                Description	                                                    Example	
# and 	                    Returns True if both statements are true	                    x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	                    Returns True if one of the statements is true	                x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	                    Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	        not(x < 5 and x < 10)



# Identity operators

# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# y = ["kiwi", "orange"]
# z = x
# print(z is   y)
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators


# kojoHeight , amaHeight =7, 5
# kojoWeight,amaWieght= 50 ,70

# bmi  = mass/h*h
# bmi  = mass/h**2  


# kojobmi  = kojoWeight/kojoHeight**2
# amabmi  = amaWieght/amaHeight**2
# print("koji's bmi is :" + str(kojobmi))
